answer gquad(Subsequence, Subsequence, Subsequence, Subsequence, Subsequence, Subsequence, Subsequence); // a guanine-quadruplex
answer gquadflank(Subsequence, Subsequence, answer, Subsequence, Subsequence); // encloses a guanine-quadruplex when it is part of another closed structure, while the above gquad rule can add a guanine-quadruplex next to other components
