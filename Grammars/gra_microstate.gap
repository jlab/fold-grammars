//the MicroState grammar is also known as "canonicals" from the RNAshapes program.

//For consistency with MacroState nil has a LOC terminal parser instead of an EMPTY terminal parser.
//applying "basepair" instead of the build-in "basepairing" or "stackpairing" to be general enough to handle single sequence and alignment predictions. Remember to import singlefold.hh or alifold.hh!

// the "with unpaired" filters are only interesting for RNAeval like instances; for singlefold or alifold they always return true. In evalfold the are false if the given position pairs with some other, thus only '.' returns true
